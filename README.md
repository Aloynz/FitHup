# FitHup

**Proposed Level of Achievement:**

Apollo 11

**Motivation**

People today lead a hectic lifestyle and have no time to take charge of
their health. This could be due to the inconvenience faced when keeping
track of their dietary habits and the frequency or intensity of their
workouts.

Dietary experts and exercise trainers may set unrealistic goals, hence
we wish to come up with a health application for people to track their
own personal health at their convenience and at their own pace.


**Vision**

FitHup will be a health cum fitness mobile application aimed at
improving the convenience of tracking one's personal health and fitness.

FitHup aims to empower individuals with the ability to be their own
personal health professional.
